# Rails-Tutorial-Blog

This tutorial steps can be found [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html "Getting Started with Rails â€” Ruby on Rails Guides"). I followed all the steps and commited in every "sub-chapter", so if there's any doubt, you can check the right chapter for each change/commit.

* Ruby version
    - 2.2.5 (Rails 5.0.0.1)

* System dependencies
    - SQLite3
    - Ruby
    - RubyGems

PS.: In my Gemfile, the only reason there's a `gem 'coffee-script-source', '1.8.0'` is because it's a easy fix for the Windows 10 version of Ruby that I'm using.
